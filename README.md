# mtDNA-heteroplasmy

## Description

This repository contains the code required to reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript "Tissue-specific apparent mtDNA heteroplasmy and its relationship with ageing and mtDNA gene expression" by Wengert et al., which is currently under revision. You can access our preprint [here](link-to-paper). 

Below, you can find a conceptual overview of the project and analyses conducted for this study:
